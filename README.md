## Responsive Webpage Design 
This project demonstrates how to convert a basic webpage into a fully responsive design that adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It also includes a mobile-friendly navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

## Features
1. Responsive Layout with CSS Media Queries:
+ The design adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring optimal readability and layout on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- The layout changes to accommodate smaller screens, providing a user-friendly experience regardless of the device.
2. Mobile-Friendly Navigation Menu:
- On smaller screens, the navigation menu collapses into a hamburger icon.
+ The menu is hidden initially and becomes visible when the hamburger icon is clicked, allowing easy access to links on mobile devices.
## Technologies Used:
+ HTML5: Structuring the webpage content.
- CSS3: Styling the webpage, including the use of media queries for responsiveness and transitions for the hamburger menu.
## Key Concepts:
1. CSS Media Queries:
+ Breakpoints are used to define different styles for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The layout shifts at breakpoints like 768px and 480px, providing an optimal user experience.
2. Hamburger Menu:
+ When the screen width is below a certain threshold (typically 768px), the navigation menu becomes a hamburger icon.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the navigation links.
## How to Use:
+ Desktop View: The website displays the full navigation bar and content.
- Tablet/Mobile View: The navigation menu collapses into a hamburger icon, which can be clicked to display or hide the navigation links.
